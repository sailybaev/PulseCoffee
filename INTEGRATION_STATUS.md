# PulseCoffee Tablet Ordering System - Integration Status

## ✅ SETUP COMPLETED

### Servers Running:
- **Backend (NestJS)**: http://localhost:3000
- **Frontend (Next.js)**: http://localhost:4321
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (connected via Supabase)

### API Endpoints Working:
- `GET /api/products/public` - Fetch all products
- `GET /api/products/public/{id}/customizations` - Fetch product customizations
- `POST /api/orders/public` - Create new orders (no authentication required)

### Database Status:
- ✅ Products seeded (8 items: coffee and pastries)
- ✅ Customizations seeded (sizes, milk types, extras, temperature)
- ✅ Branches configured (default-branch)
- ✅ Orders table supports both authenticated users and anonymous tablet orders

### Frontend Features:
- ✅ Welcome screen with tablet-optimized UI
- ✅ Menu screen fetching real products from backend
- ✅ Product customization with real options from database
- ✅ Shopping cart with add/remove/quantity controls
- ✅ Payment simulation (QR code and card options)
- ✅ Order confirmation with estimated time
- ✅ Progress bar throughout the customer journey

### Integration Verified:
- ✅ Frontend successfully loads real products from backend
- ✅ Customization options loaded dynamically per product
- ✅ Order creation works end-to-end
- ✅ CORS configured properly for frontend-backend communication
- ✅ Error handling and loading states implemented
- ✅ Price calculations include customization costs

### Authentication:
- ✅ Public endpoints use `@Public()` decorator to bypass authentication
- ✅ Tablet orders don't require user authentication
- ✅ Optional userId field in orders for future authenticated user support

### Configuration:
- **Frontend Port**: 4321 (configured in package.json)
- **Backend Port**: 3000 (configured in main.ts)
- **API Base URL**: http://localhost:3000/api
- **Mock Data**: Disabled (using real API)

## How to Start:
