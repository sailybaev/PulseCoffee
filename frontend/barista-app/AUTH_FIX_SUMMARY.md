# Authentication Fix Summary

## Issue Resolution

The 401 Unauthorized error was caused by several authentication issues:

1. **Incorrect Response Format**: The backend returns `accessToken` but the frontend expected `access_token`
2. **Missing Test User**: No BARISTA role users existed in the database
3. **Cookie-based Refresh Tokens**: The backend uses HTTP-only cookies for refresh tokens

## Changes Made

### Frontend (Barista App)
- Fixed `authService.ts` to handle `accessToken` instead of `access_token`
- Added `RegisterForm.tsx` component for creating test users
- Updated `LoginForm.tsx` to include registration option
- Updated authentication flow to use cookies for refresh tokens
- Added proper token validation and refresh logic

### Backend
- Created a test user with BARISTA role
- Verified authentication endpoints work correctly

## Test Credentials

**Phone Number**: `+1234567891`
**Password**: `password123`
**Role**: `BARISTA`

## Testing Results

✅ User registration works
✅ User login works  
✅ JWT token generation works
✅ Orders endpoint with authentication works
✅ Frontend authentication flow works

## Next Steps

1. Use the test credentials to log into the barista app
2. Test the complete order management workflow
3. Verify WebSocket real-time updates
4. Test sound notifications
5. Test branch filtering and device registration

## URLs

- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3001
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:3000/api
- **Test Orders Endpoint**: http://localhost:3000/api/orders/branch/UDP

The authentication is now working correctly and the barista app should be fully functional.
