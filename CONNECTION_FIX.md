# CONNECTION ISSUE RESOLVED âœ…

## Problem:
- Frontend was getting `NS_ERROR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` when trying to connect to backend API
- User reported connection errors on the frontend

## Root Cause:
- The API service in the frontend (`src/services/api.ts`) was configured to connect to port **3001**
- But the backend server was actually running on port **3000**
- This caused all API calls from frontend to fail with connection refused errors

## Solution Applied:
1. **Fixed API Base URL**: Changed frontend API configuration from `http://localhost:3001/api` to `http://localhost:3000/api`
2. **Restarted Frontend**: Restarted the Next.js development server to apply the configuration change
3. **Verified Integration**: Confirmed both servers are communicating properly

## Files Modified:
- `frontend/pulse-tablet/src/services/api.ts` - Updated API_BASE_URL from port 3001 to 3000

## Current Status:
- âœ… **Backend**: Running on `http://localhost:3000` 
- âœ… **Frontend**: Running on `http://localhost:4321`
- âœ… **API Communication**: Working correctly
- âœ… **Database Queries**: Backend logs show successful product/customization queries from frontend
- âœ… **CORS**: Properly configured and working

## Verification:
- Frontend successfully loads products from backend API
- Backend logs show active API requests from frontend
- No more connection refused errors
- Integration test passed: Products, customizations, and orders all working

The self-service tablet ordering system is now fully functional with proper frontend-backend integration! ðŸŽ‰
